MVC Architecture in Spring
====================================================sss

1. Client make a Http request to server.
2. Front-ent controller is first component which interact with this request. In spring MVC this is 'DispacherServlet' class.
3. Now froent-end controller consult to Handler-Mapper to get the correct Controller for this request.
4. Once froent-end controller known the Controller it delegate the client request to it.
5. Controller perform logic on this request and produce data, and wrap this data in object which is called model and passes this to froent-end controller
    along with view name.
6. Front-ent controller consult to View Resolver with this view name to get exact view location.
7. Once View location is known to Froent-end controller it passed model to that view. View prepare output by wrapping HTML.. to this model and pass return 
this to frornd controller.
8. Finally froent-end controller return HTTP Response to client brower, browser easily render to the client.
