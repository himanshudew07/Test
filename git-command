Fork : this is used to copy codebase from some other repo to your own repo.
git clone url
git add fileName
git status
git commit -m 'message'

git pull 
git checkout --fileName (or) git checkout .   -> all file

git branch : display branches
git branch <branch_name> : create new branch as <branch_name>
git checkout <branch_name> : swich to <branch_name>

git merge <branch_name>  : merge changes of brance_name to current branch
git push --set-upstream origin <branch_name>
git branch -D <branch_name>

git show HEAD (or) git show <commit_id>  : show changes on latest commit
git difftool <commit_id_old> <commit_id_new> : show what changes has been made between these two commit id
git difftool HEAD~1 HEAD~2


git checkout <commit_id> : in this case HEAD refer to some old commit id ,this is called DETACHED HEAD STATE

.gitignore : this file will contain all the file name which you want to ignore so this will not be displayed if we check status.
